# Interpreted Test Programming Language
**I**nterpreted **T**est **P**rogramming **L**anguage also known as **ITPL**.

Current version: alpha 0.0.1

## About
ITPL is just as it's name says, my attempt at creating an interpreted programming language in C#.

## Current Features
Currently ITPL is still in it's infancy, that means it does **nothing** (except print valid tokens, but 
that doesn't count) yet.

## Compatibility
It should be able to run on Linux, MacOS and Windows, provided that you have a C# compiler for .NET 5.0 installed in your machine.

Be aware that I have only tested it on MacOS, but I believe the code is simple enough, so it should 
pose no problem.
